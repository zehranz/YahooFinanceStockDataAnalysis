## Financial Indicators

### RSI

The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator used to identify overbought and oversold zones by analyzing changes in the closing price of an asset. RSI typically takes values between 0 and 100. RSI values above 70 indicate overbought conditions, while values below 30 indicate oversold conditions.
### MACD

The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) represents the difference between two moving averages and is commonly used to determine the strength and direction of an asset's trend. Crossovers between the MACD line and the signal line can be interpreted as buy and sell signals. The histogram illustrates the difference between the MACD and the signal line.
